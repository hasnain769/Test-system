Getting Started with the Functional Tests Calculator: A Simple Guide

Welcome! This guide will show you how to set up and use the Functional Tests Calculator on your own computer. Don't worry, itâ€™s very easy and there are no complicated steps.

Part 1: What You Need (Dependencies)

The calculator is a simple web page. The only "dependency" or special software you need is a modern web browser.

You almost certainly already have one installed on your computer! Here are the most common ones:

âœ… Action: You don't need to do anything if you already use one of these to browse the internet.

If for some reason you don't have a modern browser, you can download one for free:

Download Google Chrome: google.com/chrome

Download Mozilla Firefox: mozilla.org/firefox

Part 2: Download and Set Up the Calculator Files

The calculator is made of three files that work together. You will likely receive them in a single compressed ZIP file. Your first step is to "unzip" this file.

Step 1: Find the ZIP File

Locate the downloaded file. It will probably be in your Downloads folder and have a name like functional-calculator.zip. The icon usually looks like a folder with a zipper on it.

Step 2: Unzip the File

On Windows:

Right-click on the ZIP file.

Choose "Extract All..." from the menu.

A new window will pop up. Click the "Extract" button.

On Mac:

Simply double-click the ZIP file.

Step 3: Check Your Files

After extracting, a new, regular folder will be created. Open it.

Inside, you should see these three files. It is very important that all three files are in the same folder together.

index.html (This is the main file, it might have a browser icon)

style.css (This file handles the colors and layout)

script.js (This file does all the math)

Part 3: How to Run the Calculator

This is the easiest part!

Open the folder containing the three files.

Find the index.html file.

Double-click on index.html.

That's it! The file will open in your default web browser, and you will see the Functional Tests Assessment System page, ready to be used.

Part 4: How to Use the Calculator

Now that the calculator is open, hereâ€™s how to use it.

1. Fill in the Test Results:

Go through each of the 5 test sections on the page.

For tests requiring a number (like time in seconds or strength in kg), type the number into the box.

For tests with options (like flexibility reach), click the dropdown menu and choose the one that matches the result.

Remember to select a Gender for the Strength test, as this changes the scoring.

2. Calculate the Results:

Once all fields are filled, scroll to the bottom.

Click the big green button that says "Calculate Results ðŸ”¢".

3. View the Report:

The page will automatically show you a full report, including:

Your Overall Score at the top.

A Detailed Table with scores for each test.

Personalized Recommendations for every single test, explaining what your results mean and how to improve.

4. Share the Results (Optional):

At the bottom of the report, you can click the "Send Results via WhatsApp ðŸ“¤" button to easily share a summary with a client or friend.

Troubleshooting: What to Do If Something Goes Wrong

Problem: I click the "Calculate Results" button, but nothing happens.

Solution 1: Check for Empty Fields. Make sure you have filled in every single box and selected an option from every dropdown. An empty field can stop the calculation. If a box is empty, it will be highlighted with a red border.

Solution 2: Hard Refresh the Page. Your browser might have an old version of the file saved.

On Windows: Press Ctrl + F5 at the same time.

On Mac: Press Cmd + Shift + R at the same time.

Then, try filling in the form and calculating again.

Problem: The page looks plain and ugly (just black text on a white background).

Solution: This usually means the style.css file is missing or in the wrong place. Make sure all three files (index.html, style.css, script.js) are in the exact same folder.

Problem: I double-clicked index.html and it opened in Notepad or another text program.

Solution: Your computer doesn't know to use a browser for this file.

Right-click on the index.html file.

Go to "Open with".

Choose your web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.) from the list.
